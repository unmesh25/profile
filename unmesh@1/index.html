Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me. 
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. 
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best. 
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts. 
Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me. 
In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. 
Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later. 
Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. 
It always seems impossible until it's done.
